Ancient and Medieval\\nphilosophers might have said that metaphysics was, like chemistry or\\nastrology, to be defined by its subject-matter: metaphysics was the\\n“science” that studied “being as such” or\\n“the first causes of things” or “things that do not\\nchange”. It is no longer possible to define metaphysics that\\nway, for two reasons. First, a philosopher who denied the existence of\\nthose things that had once been seen as constituting the\\nsubject-matter of metaphysics—first causes or unchanging\\nthings—would now be considered to be making thereby a\\nmetaphysical assertion. Second, there are many philosophical problems\\nthat are now considered to be metaphysical problems (or at least\\npartly metaphysical problems) that are in no way related to first\\ncauses or unchanging things—the problem of free will, for\\nexample, or the problem of the mental and the physical.\\n\\nThe first three sections of this entry examine a broad selection of\\nproblems considered to be metaphysical and discuss ways in which the\\npurview of metaphysics has expanded over time. We shall see that the\\ncentral problems of metaphysics were significantly more unified in the\\nAncient and Medieval eras. Which raises a question—is there any\\ncommon feature that unites the problems of contemporary metaphysics?\\nThe final two sections discuss some recent theories of the nature and\\nmethodology of metaphysics. We will also consider arguments that\\nmetaphysics, however defined, is an impossible enterprise.\\n\\n\\n\\n1. The Word ‘Metaphysics’ and the Concept of Metaphysics\\n2. The Problems of Metaphysics: the “Old” Metaphysics\\n\\n2.1 Being As Such, First Causes, Unchanging Things\\n2.2 Categories of Being and Universals\\n2.3 Substance\\n\\n3.

The Methodology of Metaphysics\\n5. Is Metaphysics Possible?\\nBibliography\\nAcademic Tools\\nOther Internet Resources\\nRelated Entries\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1. The Word ‘Metaphysics’ and the Concept of Metaphysics\\n\\nThe word ‘metaphysics’ is notoriously hard to define.\\nTwentieth-century coinages like ‘meta-language’ and\\n‘metaphilosophy’ encourage the impression that metaphysics\\nis a study that somehow “goes beyond” physics, a study\\ndevoted to matters that transcend the mundane concerns of Newton and\\nEinstein and Heisenberg. This impression is mistaken. The word\\n‘metaphysics’ is derived from a collective title of the\\nfourteen books by Aristotle that we currently think of as making up\\nAristotle’s Metaphysics. Aristotle himself did not know\\nthe word. (He had four names for the branch of philosophy that is the\\nsubject-matter of Metaphysics: ‘first philosophy’,\\n‘first science’, ‘wisdom’, and\\n‘theology’.) At least one hundred years after\\nAristotle’s death, an editor of his works (in all probability,\\nAndronicus of Rhodes) titled those fourteen books “Ta meta\\nta phusika”—“the after the physicals” or\\n“the ones after the physical ones”—the\\n“physical ones” being the books contained in what we now\\ncall Aristotle’s Physics. The title was probably meant\\nto warn students of Aristotle’s philosophy that they should\\nattempt Metaphysics only after they had mastered “the physical\\nones”, the books about nature or the natural world—that is\\nto say, about change, for change is the defining feature of the\\nnatural world.\\n\\nThis is the probable meaning of the title because Metaphysics\\nis about things that do not change. In one place, Aristotle identifies\\nthe subject-matter of first philosophy as “being as such”,\\nand, in another as “first causes”. It is a nice—and\\nvexed—question what the connection between these two definitions\\nis. Perhaps this is the answer: The unchanging first causes have\\nnothing but being in common with the mutable things they cause. Like\\nus and the objects of our experience—they are, and there the\\nresemblance ceases. (For a detailed and informative recent guide to\\nAristotle’s Metaphysics, see Politis 2004.)\\n\\nShould we assume that ‘metaphysics’ is a name for that\\n“science” which is the subject-matter of Aristotle’s\\nMetaphysics? If we assume this, we should be committed to\\nsomething in the neighborhood of the following theses:\\n\\nThe subject-matter of metaphysics is “being as\\nsuch”\\nThe subject-matter of metaphysics is the first causes of\\nthings\\nThe subject-matter of metaphysics is that which does not\\nchange\\n\\n\\nAny of these three theses might have been regarded as a defensible\\nstatement of the subject-matter of what was called\\n‘metaphysics’ until the seventeenth century. But then,\\nrather suddenly, many topics and problems that Aristotle and the\\nMedievals would have classified as belonging to physics (the relation\\nof mind and body, for example, or the freedom of the will, or personal\\nidentity across time) began to be reassigned to metaphysics. One might\\nalmost say that in the seventeenth century metaphysics began to be a\\ncatch-all category, a repository of philosophical problems that could\\nnot be otherwise classified as epistemology, logic, ethics or other\\nbranches of philosophy. (It was at about that time that the word\\n‘ontology’ was invented—to be a name for the science\\nof being as such, an office that the word ‘metaphysics’\\ncould no longer fill.) The academic rationalists of the\\npost-Leibnizian school were aware that the word\\n‘metaphysics’ had come to be used in a more inclusive\\nsense than it had once been. Christian Wolff attempted to justify this\\nmore inclusive sense of the word by this device: while the\\nsubject-matter of metaphysics is being, being can be investigated\\neither in general or in relation to objects in particular categories.\\nHe distinguished between ‘general metaphysics’ (or\\nontology), the study of being as such, and the various branches of\\n‘special metaphysics’, which study the being of objects of\\nvarious special sorts, such as souls and material bodies. (He does not\\nassign first causes to general metaphysics, however: the study of\\nfirst causes belongs to natural theology, a branch of special\\nmetaphysics.) It is doubtful whether this maneuver is anything more\\nthan a verbal ploy. In what sense, for example, is the practitioner of\\nrational psychology (the branch of special metaphysics devoted to the\\nsoul) engaged in a study of being? Do souls have a different sort of\\nbeing from that of other objects?—so that in studying the soul\\none learns not only about its nature (that is, its properties:\\nrationality, immateriality, immortality, its capacity or lack thereof\\nto affect the body …), but also about its “mode of\\nbeing”, and hence learns something about being? It is certainly\\nnot true that all, or even very many, rational psychologists said\\nanything, qua rational psychologists, that could plausibly be\\nconstrued as a contribution to our understanding of being.\\n\\nPerhaps the wider application of the word ‘metaphysics’\\nwas due to the fact that the word ‘physics’ was coming to\\nbe a name for a new, quantitative science, the science that bears that\\nname today, and was becoming increasingly inapplicable to the\\ninvestigation of many traditional philosophical problems about\\nchanging things (and of some newly discovered problems about changing\\nthings).\\n\\nWhatever the reason for the change may have been, it would be flying\\nin the face of current usage (and indeed of the usage of the last\\nthree or four hundred years) to stipulate that the subject-matter of\\nmetaphysics was to be the subject-matter of Aristotle’s\\nMetaphysics. It would, moreover, fly in the face of the fact\\nthat there are and have been paradigmatic metaphysicians who deny that\\nthere are first causes—this denial is certainly a metaphysical\\nthesis in the current sense—others who insist that everything\\nchanges (Heraclitus and any more recent philosopher who is both a\\nmaterialist and a nominalist), and others still (Parmenides and Zeno)\\nwho deny that there is a special class of objects that do not change.\\nIn trying to characterize metaphysics as a field, the best starting\\npoint is to consider the myriad topics traditionally assigned to\\nit.\\n2. The Problems of Metaphysics: the “Old” Metaphysics\\n2.1 Being As Such, First Causes, Unchanging Things\\n\\nIf metaphysics now considers a wider range of problems than those\\nstudied in Aristotle’s Metaphysics, those original\\nproblems continue to belong to its subject-matter. For instance, the\\ntopic of “being as such” (and “existence as\\nsuch”, if existence is something other than being) is one of the\\nmatters that belong to metaphysics on any conception of metaphysics.\\nThe following theses are all paradigmatically metaphysical:\\n\\n“Being is; not-being is not” [Parmenides];\\n“Essence precedes existence” [Avicenna,\\nparaphrased];\\n“Existence in reality is greater than existence in the\\nunderstanding alone” [St Anselm, paraphrased];\\n“Existence is a perfection” [Descartes,\\nparaphrased];\\n“Being is a logical, not a real predicate” [Kant,\\nparaphrased];\\n“Being is the most barren and abstract of all\\ncategories” [Hegel, paraphrased];\\n“Affirmation of existence is in fact nothing but denial of\\nthe number zero” [Frege];\\n“Universals do not exist but rather subsist or have\\nbeing” [Russell, paraphrased];\\n“To be is to be the value of a bound variable”\\n[Quine].\\n“An object’s degree of being is proportionate to the\\nnaturalness of its mode of existence” [McDaniel].\\n\\n\\nIt seems reasonable, moreover, to say that investigations into\\nnon-being belong to the topic “being as such” and thus\\nbelong to metaphysics. (This did not seem reasonable to Meinong, who\\nwished to confine the subject-matter of metaphysics to “the\\nactual” and who therefore did not regard his Theory of Objects\\nas a metaphysical theory. According to the conception of metaphysics\\nadopted in this article, however, his thesis [paraphrased]\\n“Predication is independent of being” is paradigmatically\\nmetaphysical.)\\n\\nThe topics “the first causes of things” and\\n“unchanging things”—have continued to interest\\nmetaphysicians, though they are not now seen as having any important\\nconnection with the topic “being as such”. The first three\\nof Aquinas’s Five Ways are metaphysical arguments on any\\nconception of metaphysics. Additionally the thesis that there are no\\nfirst causes and the thesis that there are no things that do not\\nchange count as metaphysical theses, for in the current conception of\\nmetaphysics, the denial of a metaphysical thesis is a metaphysical\\nthesis. No post-Medieval philosopher would say anything like this:\\n\\n\\nI study the first causes of things, and am therefore a metaphysician.\\nMy colleague Dr McZed denies that there are any first causes and is\\ntherefore not a metaphysician; she is rather, an anti-metaphysician.\\nIn her view, metaphysics is a science with a non-existent\\nsubject-matter, like astrology.\\n\\n\\nThis feature of the contemporary conception of metaphysics is nicely\\nillustrated by a statement of Sartre’s:\\n\\n\\nI do not think myself any less a metaphysician in denying the\\nexistence of God than Leibniz was in affirming it. (1949: 139)\\n\\n\\nAn anti-metaphysician in the contemporary sense is not a philosopher\\nwho denies that there are objects of the sorts that an earlier\\nphilosopher might have said formed the subject-matter of metaphysics\\n(first causes, things that do not change, universals, substances,\\n…), but rather a philosopher who denies the legitimacy of the\\nquestion whether there are objects of those sorts.\\n\\nThe three original topics—the nature of being; the first causes\\nof things; things that do not change—remained topics of\\ninvestigation by metaphysicians after Aristotle. Another topic,\\ndiscussed in the following subsection, occupies an intermediate\\nposition between Aristotle and his successors.\\n2.2 Categories of Being and Universals\\n\\nWe human beings sort things into various classes. And we often suppose\\nthat the classes into which we sort things enjoy a kind of internal\\nunity. In this respect they differ from sets in the strict sense of\\nthe word. (And no doubt in others. It would seem, for example, that we\\nthink of the classes we sort things into—biological species,\\nsay—as comprising different members at different times.) The\\nclasses into which we sort things are in most cases\\n“natural” classes, classes whose membership is in some\\nimportant sense uniform—“kinds”. We shall not\\nattempt an account or definition of ‘natural class’ here.\\nExamples must suffice. There are certainly sets whose members do not\\nmake up natural classes: a set that contains all dogs but one, and a\\nset that contains all dogs and exactly one cat do not correspond to\\nnatural classes in anyone’s view. And it is tempting to suppose\\nthat there is a sense of “natural” in which dogs make up a\\nnatural class, to suppose that in dividing the world into dogs and\\nnon-dogs, we “cut nature at the joints”. It is, however, a\\nrespectable philosophical thesis that the idea of a natural class\\ncannot survive philosophical scrutiny. If that respectable thesis is\\ntrue, the topic “the categories of being” is a\\npseudo-topic. Let us simply assume that the respectable thesis is\\nfalse and that things fall into various natural\\nclasses—hereinafter, simply classes.\\n\\nSome of the classes into which we sort things are more comprehensive\\nthan others: all dogs are animals, but not all animals are dogs; all\\nanimals are living organisms, but not all living organisms are animals\\n…. Now the very expression “sort things into\\nclasses” suggests that there is a most comprehensive class: the\\nclass of things, the class of things that can be sorted into classes.\\nBut is this so?—and if it is so, are there classes that are\\n“just less comprehensive” than this universal class? If\\nthere are, can we identify them?—and are there a vast (perhaps\\neven an infinite) number of them, or some largish, messy number like\\nforty-nine, or some small, neat number like seven or four? Let us call\\nany such less comprehensive classes the ‘categories of\\nbeing’ or the ‘ontological categories’. (The former\\nterm, if not the latter, presupposes a particular position on one\\nquestion about the nature of being: that everything is, that the\\nuniversal class is the class of beings, the class of things that are.\\nIt thus presupposes that Meinong was wrong to say that “there\\nare things of which it is true that there are no such\\nthings”.)\\n\\nThe topic “the categories of being” is intermediate\\nbetween the topic “the nature of being” and the topics\\nthat fall under the post-Medieval conception of metaphysics for a\\nreason that can be illustrated by considering the problem of\\nuniversals. Universals, if they indeed exist, are, in the first\\ninstance, properties or qualities or attributes (i.e.,\\n“ductility” or “whiteness”) that are\\nsupposedly universally “present in” the members of classes\\nof things and relations (i.e., “being to the north of”)\\nthat are supposedly universally present in the members of classes of\\nsequences of things. “In the first instance”: it may be\\nthat things other than qualities and relations are universals,\\nalthough qualities and relations are the items most commonly put\\nforward as examples of universals. It may be that the novel War\\nand Peace is a universal, a thing that is in some mode present in\\neach of the many tangible copies of the novel. It may be that the word\\n“horse” is a universal, a thing that is present in each of\\nthe many audible utterances of the word. And it may be that natural\\nclasses or kinds are themselves universals—it may be that there\\nis such a thing as “the horse” or the species Equus\\ncaballus, distinct from its defining attribute “being a\\nhorse” or “equinity”, and in some sense\\n“present in” each horse. (Perhaps some difference between\\nthe attribute “being a horse” and the attribute\\n“being either a horse or a kitten” explains why the former\\nis the defining attribute of a kind and the latter is not. Perhaps the\\nformer attribute exists and the latter does not; perhaps the former\\nhas the second-order attribute “naturalness” and the\\nlatter does not; perhaps the former is more easily apprehended by the\\nintellect than the latter.)\\n\\nThe thesis that universals exist—or at any rate\\n“subsist” or “have being”—is variously\\ncalled ‘realism’ or ‘Platonic realism’ or\\n‘platonism’. All three terms are objectionable. Aristotle\\nbelieved in the reality of universals, but it would be at best an\\noxymoron to call him a platonist or a Platonic realist. And\\n‘realism’ tout court has served as a name for a variety of\\nphilosophical theses. The thesis that universals do not exist—do\\nnot so much as subsist; have no being of any sort—is generally\\ncalled ‘nominalism’. This term, too is objectionable. At\\none time, those who denied the existence of universals were fond of\\nsaying things like:\\n\\n\\nThere is no such thing as “being a horse”: there is only\\nthe name [nomen, gen. nominis] “horse”,\\na mere flatus vocis [puff of sound].\\n\\n\\nPresent-day nominalists, however, are aware, if earlier nominalists\\nwere not, that if the phrase ‘the name\\n“horse”\\u2009’ designated an object, the object it\\ndesignated would itself be a universal or something very like one. It\\nwould not be a mere puff of sound but would rather be what was common\\nto the many puffs of sound that were its tokens.\\n\\nThe old debate between the nominalists and the realists continues to\\nthe present day. Most realists suppose that universals constitute one\\nof the categories of being. This supposition could certainly be\\ndisputed without absurdity. Perhaps there is a natural class of things\\nto which all universals belong but which contains other things as well\\n(and is not the class of all things). Perhaps, for example, numbers\\nand propositions are not universals, and perhaps numbers and\\npropositions and universals are all members of a class of\\n“abstract objects”, a class that some things do not belong\\nto. Or perhaps there is such a thing as “the whiteness of the\\nTaj Mahal” and perhaps this object and the universal\\n“whiteness”—but not the Taj Mahal itself—both\\nbelong to the class of “properties”. Let us call such a\\nclass—a proper subclass of an ontological category, a natural\\nclass that is neither the class of all things nor one of the\\nontological categories—an ‘ontological\\nsub-category’. It may indeed be that universals make up a\\nsub-category of being and are members of the category of being\\n“abstract object”. But few if any philosophers would\\nsuppose that universals were members of forty-nine\\nsub-categories—much less of a vast number or an infinity of\\nsub-categories. Most philosophers who believe in the reality of\\nuniversals would want to say that universals, if they do not\\nconstitute an ontological category, at least constitute one of the\\n“higher” sub-categories. If dogs form a natural class,\\nthis class is—by the terms of our definition—an\\nontological sub-category. And this class will no doubt be a subclass\\nof many sub-categories: the genus canis, the class (in the\\nbiological sense) mammalia, …, and so through a chain\\nof sub-categories that eventually reaches some very general\\nsub-category like “substance” or “material\\nobject”. Thus, although dogs may compose an ontological\\nsub-category, this sub-category—unlike the category\\n“universal”—is one of the “lower” ones.\\nThese reflections suggest that the topic “the categories of\\nbeing” should be understood to comprehend both the categories of\\nbeing sensu stricto and their immediate sub-categories.\\n\\nDoes the topic “the categories of being” belong to\\nmetaphysics in the “old” sense? A case can be made for\\nsaying that it does, based on the fact that Plato’s theory of\\nforms (universals, attributes) is a recurrent theme in\\nAristotle’s Metaphysics. In Metaphysics, two\\nof Plato’s central theses about the forms come in for vigorous\\ncriticism: (i) that things that would, if they existed, be\\n“inactive” (the forms) could be the primary beings, the\\n“most real” things, and (ii) that the attributes of things\\nexist “separately” from the things whose attributes they\\nare. We shall be concerned only with (ii). In the terminology of the\\nSchools, that criticism can be put this way: Plato wrongly believed\\nthat universals existed ante res (prior to objects); the\\ncorrect view is that universals exist in rebus (in objects).\\nIt is because this aspect of the problem of universals—whether\\nuniversals exist ante res or in rebus—is\\ndiscussed at length in Metaphysics, that a strong case can be\\nmade for saying that the problem of universals falls under the old\\nconception of metaphysics. (And the question whether universals, given\\nthat they exist at all, exist ante res or in rebus\\nis as controversial in the twenty-first century as it was in the\\nthirteenth century and the fourth century B.C.E.) If we do decide that\\nthe problem of universals belongs to metaphysics on the old\\nconception, then, since we have liberalized the old conception by\\napplying to it the contemporary rule that the denial of a metaphysical\\nposition is to be regarded as a metaphysical position, we shall have\\nto say that the question whether universals exist at all is a\\nmetaphysical question under the old conception—and that\\nnominalism is therefore a metaphysical thesis.\\n\\nThere is, however, also a case to made against classifying the problem\\nof universals as a problem of metaphysics in the (liberalized) old\\nsense. For there is more to the problem of universals than the\\nquestion whether universals exist and the question whether, if they do\\nexist, their existence is ante res or in rebus. For\\nexample, the problem of universals also includes questions about the\\nrelation between universals (if such there be) and the things that are\\nnot universals, the things usually called particulars. Aristotle did\\nnot consider these questions in the Metaphysics. One might\\ntherefore plausibly contend that only one part of the problem of\\nuniversals (the part that pertains to the existence and nature of\\nuniversals) belongs to metaphysics in the old sense. At one time, a\\nphilosopher might have said,\\n\\n\\nThe universal “doghood” is a thing that does not change.\\nTherefore, questions about its nature belong to metaphysics, the\\nscience of things that do not change. But dogs are things that change.\\nTherefore, questions concerning the relation of dogs to doghood do not\\nbelong to metaphysics.\\n\\n\\nBut no contemporary philosopher would divide the topics that\\nway—not even if he or she believed that doghood existed and was\\na thing that did not change. A contemporary philosopher—if that\\nphilosopher concedes that there is any problem that can properly be\\ncalled “the problem of universals”—will see the\\nproblem of universals as a problem properly so called, as a problem\\nhaving the kind of internal unity that leads philosophers to speak of\\na philosophical problem. And the same point applies to the\\ntopic “the categories of being”: every philosopher who is\\nwilling to say that “What are the categories of being?” is\\na meaningful question will assign every aspect of that question to\\nmetaphysics\\n\\nLet us consider some aspects of the problem of universals that concern\\nchanging things. (That is, that concern particulars—for even if\\nthere are particulars that do not change, most of the particulars that\\nfigure in discussions of the problem of universals as examples are\\nthings that change.) Consider two white particulars—the Taj\\nMahal, say, and the Washington Monument. And suppose that both these\\nparticulars are white in virtue of (i.e., their being white consists\\nin) their bearing some one, identifiable relation to the universal\\n“whiteness”. Suppose further that we are able to single\\nout this relation by some sort of act of intellectual attention or\\nabstraction, and that (having done so) we have given it the name\\n“falling under”. All white things and only white things\\nfall under whiteness, and falling under whiteness is what it is to be\\nwhite. (We pass over many questions that would have to be addressed if\\nwe were discussing the problem of universals for its own sake. For\\nexample, both blueness and redness are spectral color-properties, and\\nwhiteness is not. Does this fact imply that “being a spectral\\ncolor-property” is, as one might say, a second-order universal?\\nIf so, does blueness “fall under” this universal in the\\nsame sense as the sense in which a copy of Philosophical\\nStudies falls under blueness?)\\n\\nNow what can we say about this relation, this “falling\\nunder”? What is it about the two objects whiteness and the Taj\\nMahal that is responsible for the fact that the latter falls under the\\nformer? Is the Taj perhaps a “bundle” of universalia\\nante res, and does it fall under whiteness in virtue of the fact\\nthat whiteness is one of the universals that is a constituent of the\\nbundle that it is? Or might it be that a particular like the Taj,\\nalthough it indeed has universals as constituents, is something more\\nthan its universal constituents? Might it be that the Taj has a\\nconstituent that is not a universal, a “substrate”, a\\nparticular that is in some sense property-less and that holds the\\nuniversal constituents of the Taj together—that\\n“bundles” them? (If we take that position, then we may\\nwant to say, with Armstrong (1989: 94–96), that the Taj is a\\n‘thick particular’ and its substrate a ‘thin\\nparticular’: a thick particular being a thin particular taken\\ntogether with the properties it bundles.) Or might the Taj have\\nconstituents that are neither universals nor substrates? Might we have\\nbeen too hasty when we defined ‘particulars’ as things\\nthat are not universals? Could there perhaps be two kinds of\\nnon-universals, concrete non-universals or concrete individuals (those\\nwould be the particulars, thick or thin), and abstract non-universals\\nor abstract individuals (‘accidents’ or\\n‘tropes’ or ‘property instances’), things that\\nare properties or qualities (and relations as well), things like\\n“the (individual) whiteness of the Taj Mahal”? Is the Taj\\nperhaps a bundle not of universals but of accidents? Or is it composed\\nof a substrate and a bundle of accidents? And we cannot neglect the\\npossibility that Aristotle was right and that universals exist only\\nin rebus. If that is so, we must ask what the relation is\\nbetween the matter that composes a particular and the universals that\\ninhere in it—that inhere simultaneously in “this”\\nmatter and in “that” matter.\\n\\nThe series of questions that was set out in the preceding paragraph\\nwas introduced by observing that the problem of universals includes\\nboth questions about the existence and nature of universals and\\nquestions about how universals are related to the particulars that\\nfall under them. Many of the theories that were alluded to in that\\nseries of questions could be described as theories of the\\n“ontological structure” of non-universals. We can contrast\\nontological structure with mereological structure. A philosophical\\nquestion concerns the mereological structure of an object if it is a\\nquestion about the relation between that object and those of its\\nconstituents that belong to the same ontological category as the\\nobject. For example, the philosopher who asks whether the Taj Mahal\\nhas a certain block of marble among its constituents essentially or\\nonly accidentally is asking a question about the mereological\\nstructure of the Taj, since the block and the building belong to the\\nsame ontological category. But the philosopher who asks whether the\\nTaj has “whiteness” as a constituent and the philosopher\\nwho supposes that the Taj does have this property-constituent and\\nasks, “What is the nature of this relation ‘constituent\\nof’ that ‘whiteness’ bears to the Taj?” are\\nasking questions about its ontological structure.\\n\\nMany philosophers have supposed that particulars fall under universals\\nby somehow incorporating them into their ontological structure. And\\nother philosophers have supposed that the ontological structure of a\\nparticular incorporates individual properties or accidents—and\\nthat an accident is an accident of a certain particular just in virtue\\nof being a constituent of that particular.\\n\\nAdvocates of the existence of ante res universals, and\\nparticularly those who deny that these universals are constituents of\\nparticulars, tend to suppose that universals abound—that there\\nis not only such a universal as whiteness but such a universal as\\n“being both white and round and either shiny or not made of\\nsilver”. Advocates of other theories of universals are almost\\nalways less liberal in the range of universals whose existence they\\nwill allow. The advocate of in rebus universals is unlikely\\nto grant the existence of “being both white and round and either\\nshiny or not made of silver”, even in the case in which there is\\nan object that is both white and round and either shiny or not made of\\nsilver (such as a non-shiny white plastic ball).\\n\\nThe two topics “the categories of being” and “the\\nontological structure of objects” are intimately related to each\\nother and to the problem of universals. It is not possible to propose\\na solution to the problem of universals that does not have\\nimplications for the topic “the categories of being”.\\n(Even nominalism implies that at least one popular candidate for the\\noffice “ontological category” is non-existent or empty.)\\nIt is certainly possible to maintain that there are ontological\\ncategories that are not directly related to the problem of universals\\n(“proposition”, “state of affairs”,\\n“event”, “mere possibile”), but any\\nphilosopher who maintains this will nevertheless maintain that if\\nthere are universals they make up at least one of the higher\\nontological sub-categories. And it seems that it is possible to speak\\nof ontological structure only if one supposes that there are objects\\nof different ontological categories. So whatever metaphysics\\ncomprehends, it must comprehend every aspect of the problem of\\nuniversals and every aspect of the topics “the categories of\\nbeing” and “the ontological structure of objects”.\\nFor a recent investigation of the problems that have been discussed in\\nthis section, see Lowe (2006).\\n\\nWe turn now to a topic that strictly speaking belongs to “the\\ncategories of being”, but which is important enough to be\\ntreated separately.\\n2.3 Substance\\n\\nSome things (if they exist at all) are present only “in”\\nother things: a smile, a haircut (product, not process), a hole\\n…. Such things may be opposed to things that exist “in\\ntheir own right”. Metaphysicians call the things that exist in\\ntheir own right ‘substances’. Aristotle called them\\n‘protai ousiai’ or “primary beings”.\\nThey make up the most important of his ontological categories. Several\\nfeatures define protai ousiai: they are subjects of\\npredication that cannot themselves be predicated of things (they are\\nnot universals); things exist “in” them, but they do not\\nexist “in” things (they are not accidents like\\nSocrates’ wisdom or his ironic smile); they have determinate\\nidentities (essences). This last feature could be put this way in\\ncontemporary terms: if the prote ousia x exists at a\\ncertain time and the prote ousia y exists at some\\nother time, it makes sense to ask whether x and y\\nare the same, are numerically identical (and the question must have a\\ndeterminate answer); and the question whether a given prote\\nousia would exist in some set of counterfactual circumstances\\nmust likewise have an answer (at least if the circumstances are\\nsufficiently determinate—if, for example, they constitute a\\npossible world. More on this in the next section). It is difficult to\\nsuppose that smiles or holes have this sort of determinate identity.\\nTo ask whether the smile Socrates smiled today is the smile he smiled\\nyesterday (or is the smile he would have smiled if Crito had asked one\\nof his charmingly naïve questions) can only be a question about\\ndescriptive identity.\\n\\nAristotle uses ‘(prote) ousia’ not only\\nas a count-noun but as a mass term. (He generally writes\\n‘ousia’ without qualification when he believes\\nthat the context will make it clear that he means ‘prote\\nousia’.) For example, he not only asks questions like\\n“Is Socrates a (prote) ousia?” and\\n“What is a (prote) ousia”?, but\\nquestions like “What is the (prote) ousia of\\nSocrates?” and “What is (prote)\\nousia?” (Which question he is asking sometimes has to\\nbe inferred from the context, since there is no indefinite article in\\nGreek.) In the count-noun sense of the term, Aristotle identifies at\\nleast some (protai) ousiai with ta\\nhupokeimena or “underlying things”. Socrates, for\\nexample, is a hupokeimenon in that he “lies\\nunder” the in rebus universals under which he falls and\\nthe accidents that inhere in him. ‘To\\nhupokeimenon’ has an approximate Latin equivalent in\\n‘substantia’, “that which stands\\nunder”. (Apparently, “to stand under” and “to\\nlie under” are equally good metaphorical descriptions of the\\nrelations a thing bears to its qualities and accidents.) Owing both to\\nthe close association of (protai) ousiai and\\nhupokeimena in Aristotle’s philosophy and to the\\nabsence of a suitable Latin equivalent of ‘ousia’\\n‘substantia’ became the customary Latin\\ntranslation of the count-noun ‘(prote)\\nousia’.\\n\\nThe question whether there in fact are substances continues to be one\\nof the central questions of metaphysics. Several closely related\\nquestions are: How, precisely, should the concept of substance be\\nunderstood?; Which of the items (if any of them) among those we\\nencounter in everyday life are substances?; If there are substances at\\nall, how many of them are there?—is there only one as Spinoza\\ncontended, or are there many as most of the rationalists supposed?;\\nWhat kinds of substances are there?—are there immaterial\\nsubstances, eternal substances, necessarily existent substances?\\n\\nIt must be emphasized that there is no universally accepted and\\nprecise definition of ‘substance’. Depending on how one\\nunderstood the word (or the concept) one might say either that Hume\\ndenied that there were any substances or that he held that the only\\nsubstances (or the only substances of which we have any knowledge)\\nwere impressions and ideas. It would seem, however, that most\\nphilosophers who are willing to use the word ‘substance’\\nat all would deny that any of the following (if they exist) are\\nsubstances:\\n\\nUniversals and other abstract objects. (It should be noted that\\nAristotle criticized Plato for supposing that the protai\\nousiai were ante res universals.)\\nEvents, processes, or changes. (But some metaphysicians contend\\nthat substance/event is a false dichotomy.)\\nStuffs, such as flesh or iron or butter. (Unfortunately for\\nbeginning students of metaphysics, the usual meaning of\\n‘substance’ outside philosophy is stuff. Aristotle\\ncriticized “the natural philosophers” for supposing that\\nthe prote ousia could be a stuff—water or air or fire\\nor matter.)\\n\\n\\nThe nature of being, the problem of universals, and the nature of\\nsubstance have been recognized as topics that belong to\\n“metaphysics” by almost everyone who has used the word. We\\nnow turn to topics that belong to metaphysics only in the\\npost-Medieval sense.\\n3. The Problems of Metaphysics: the “New” Metaphysics\\n3.1 Modality\\n\\nPhilosophers have long recognized that there is an important\\ndistinction within the class of true propositions: the distinction\\nbetween those propositions that might have been false and those that\\ncould not have been false (those that must be true). Compare, for\\nexample, the proposition that Paris is the capital of France and the\\nproposition that there is a prime between every number greater than 1\\nand its double. Both are true, but the former could have been false\\nand the latter could not have been false. Likewise, there is a\\ndistinction to be made within the class of false propositions: between\\nthose that could have been true and those that could not have been\\ntrue (those that had to be false).\\n\\nSome Medieval philosophers supposed that the fact that true\\npropositions are of the two sorts “necessarily true” and\\n“contingently true” (and the corresponding fact about\\nfalse propositions) showed that there were two “modes” in\\nwhich a proposition could be true (or false): the mode of contingency\\nand the mode of necessity—hence the term ‘modality’.\\nPresent-day philosophers retain the Medieval term\\n‘modality’ but now it means no more than “pertaining\\nto possibility and necessity”. The types of modality of interest\\nto metaphysicians fall into two camps: modality de re and\\nmodality de dicto.\\n\\nModality de dicto is the modality of propositions\\n(‘dictum’ means proposition, or close enough). If\\nmodality were coextensive with modality de dicto, it would be\\nat least a defensible position that the topic of modality belongs to\\nlogic rather than to metaphysics. (Indeed, the study of modal logics\\ngoes back to Aristotle’s Prior Analytics.)\\n\\nBut many philosophers also think there is a second kind of modality,\\nmodality de re—the modality of things. (The modality of\\nsubstances, certainly, and perhaps of things in other ontological\\ncategories.) The status of modality de re is undeniably a\\nmetaphysical topic, and we assign it to the “new”\\nmetaphysics because, although one can ask modal questions about things\\nthat do not change—God, for example, or universals—a large\\nproportion of the work that has been done in this area concerns the\\nmodal features of changing things.\\n\\nThere are two types of modality de re. The first concerns the\\nexistence of things—of human beings, for example. If Sally, an\\nordinary human being, says, “I might not have existed”,\\nalmost everyone will take her to have stated an obvious truth. And if\\nwhat she has said is indeed true, then she exists contingently. That\\nis to say, she is a contingent being: a being who might not have\\nexisted. A necessary being, in contrast, is a being of which it is\\nfalse that it might not have existed. Whether any objects are\\nnecessary beings is an important question of modal metaphysics. Some\\nphilosophers have gone so far to maintain that all objects are\\nnecessary beings, since necessary existence is a truth of logic in\\nwhat seems to them to be the best quantified modal logic. (See Barcan\\n1946 for the first modern connection between necessary existence and\\nquantified modal logic. Barcan did not draw any metaphysical\\nconclusions from her logical results, but later authors, especially\\nWilliamson 2013 have.)\\n\\nThe second kind of modality de re concerns the properties of\\nthings. Like the existence of things, the possession of properties by\\nthings is subject to modal qualification. If Sally, who speaks\\nEnglish, says, “I might have spoken only French”, almost\\neveryone will take that statement to be no less obviously true than\\nher statement that she might not have existed. And if what she has\\nsaid is indeed true, then “speaking English” is a property\\nthat she has only contingently or (the more usual word) only\\naccidentally. Additionally there may be properties which some objects\\nhave essentially. A thing has a property essentially if it could not\\nexist without having that property. Examples of essential properties\\ntend to be controversial, largely because the most plausible examples\\nof a certain object’s possessing a property essentially are only\\nas plausible as the thesis that that object possesses those properties\\nat all. For example, if Sally is a physical object, as physicalists\\nsuppose, then it is very plausible for them to suppose further that\\nshe is essentially a physical object—but it is controversial\\nwhether they are right to suppose that she is a physical object. And,\\nof course, the same thing can be said, mutatis mutandis,\\nconcerning dualists and the property of being a non-physical object.\\nIt would seem, however, that Sally is either essentially a physical\\nobject or essentially a non-physical object. And many find it\\nplausible to suppose that (whether she is physical or non-physical)\\nshe has the property “not being a poached egg”\\nessentially.\\n\\nThe most able and influential enemy of modality (both de\\ndicto and de re) was W. V. Quine, who vigorously\\ndefended both the following theses. First, that modality de\\ndicto can be understood only in terms of the concept of\\nanalyticity (a problematical concept in his view). Secondly, that\\nmodality de re cannot be understood in terms of analyticity\\nand therefore cannot be understood at all. Quine argued for this\\nlatter claim by proposing what he took to be decisive counterexamples\\nto theories that take essentiality to be meaningful. If modality\\nde re makes any sense, Quine contended (1960: 199–200),\\ncyclists must be regarded as essentially bipedal—for\\n“Cyclists are bipedal” would be regarded as an analytic\\nsentence by those who believe in analyticity. But mathematicians are\\nonly accidentally bipedal (“Mathematicians are bipedal” is\\nnot analytic by anyone’s lights). What then, Quine proceeded to\\nask, of someone who is both a mathematician and a cyclist?—that\\nperson seems both essentially and only accidentally bi-pedal. Since\\nthis is incoherent, Quine thought that modality de re is\\nincoherent.\\n\\nMost philosophers are now convinced, however, that Quine’s\\n“mathematical cyclist” argument has been adequately\\nanswered by Saul Kripke (1972), Alvin Plantinga (1974) and various\\nother defenders of modality de re. Kripke and\\nPlantinga’s defenses of modality are paradigmatically\\nmetaphysical (except insofar as they directly address Quine’s\\nlinguistic argument). Both make extensive use of the concept of a\\npossible world in defending the intelligibility of modality (both\\nde re and de dicto). Leibniz was the first\\nphilosopher to use ‘possible world’ as a philosophical\\nterm of art, but Kripke’s and Plantinga’s use of the\\nphrase is different from his. For Leibniz, a possible world was a\\npossible creation: God’s act of creation consists in his\\nchoosing one possible world among many to be the one world that he\\ncreates—the “actual” world. For Kripke and\\nPlantinga, however, a possible world is a possible “whole of\\nreality”. For Leibniz, God and his actions “stand\\noutside” all possible worlds. For Kripke and Plantinga, no\\nbeing, not even God, could stand outside the whole system of possible\\nworlds. A Kripke-Plantinga (KP) world is an abstract object of some\\nsort. Let us suppose that a KP world is a possible state of affairs\\n(this is Plantinga’s idea; Kripke says nothing so definite).\\nConsider any given state of affairs; let us say, Paris being the\\ncapital of France. This state of affairs obtains, since Paris\\nis the capital of France. By contrast, the state of affairs\\nTours being the capital of France does not obtain. The latter\\nstate of affairs does, however, exist, for there is such a state of\\naffairs. (Obtaining thus stands to states of affairs as truth stands\\nto propositions: although the proposition that Tours is the capital of\\nFrance is not true, there nevertheless is such a proposition.) The\\nstate of affairs x is said to include the state of affairs\\ny if it is impossible for x to obtain and y\\nnot to obtain. If it is impossible for both x and y\\nto obtain, then each precludes the other. A possible world is simply a\\npossible state of affairs that, for every state of affairs x,\\neither includes or precludes x; the actual world is the one\\nsuch state of affairs that obtains.\\n\\nUsing the KP theory we can answer Quine’s challenge as follows.\\nIn every possible world, every cyclist in that world is bipedal in\\nthat world. (Assuming with Quine that necessarily cyclists are\\nbipedal. Apparently he had not foreseen adaptive bicycles.)\\nNevertheless for any particular cyclist, there is some possible world\\nwhere he (the same person) is not bipedal. Once we draw this\\ndistinction, we can see that Quine’s argument is invalid. More\\ngenerally, on the KP theory, theses about de re essential\\nproperties need not be analytic; they are meaningful because they\\nexpress claims about an object’s properties in various possible\\nworlds.\\n\\nWe can also use the notion of possible worlds to define many other\\nmodal concepts. For example, a necessarily true proposition is a\\nproposition that would be true no matter what possible world was\\nactual. Socrates is a contingent being if there is some possible world\\nsuch that he would not exist if that world were actual, and he has the\\nproperty “being human” essentially if every possible world\\nthat includes his existence also includes his being human. Kripke and\\nPlantinga have greatly increased the clarity of modal discourse (and\\nparticularly of modal discourse de re), but at the expense of\\nintroducing a modal ontology, an ontology of possible worlds.\\n\\nTheirs is not the only modal ontology on offer. The main alternative\\nto the KP theory has been the ‘modal realism’ championed\\nby David Lewis (1986). Lewis’s modal ontology appeals to objects\\ncalled possible worlds, but these “worlds” are concrete\\nobjects. What we call the actual world is one of these concrete\\nobjects, the spatiotemporally connected universe we inhabit. What we\\ncall “non-actual” worlds are other concrete universes that\\nare spatiotemporally isolated from ours (and from each other). There\\nis, Lewis contends, a vast array of non-actual worlds, an array that\\ncontains at least those worlds that are generated by an ingenious\\nprinciple of recombination, a principle that can be stated without the\\nuse of modal language (1986: 87). For Lewis, moreover,\\n“actual” is an indexical term: when I speak of the actual\\nworld, I refer to the world of which I am an inhabitant—and so\\nfor any speaker who is “in” (who is a part of) any\\nworld.\\n\\nIn the matter of modality de dicto, Lewis’s theory\\nproceeds in a manner that is at least parallel to the KP theory: there\\ncould be flying pigs if there are flying pigs in some possible world\\n(if some world has flying pigs as parts). But the case is otherwise\\nwith modality de re. Since every ordinary object is in only\\none of the concrete worlds, Lewis must either say that each such\\nobject has all its properties essentially or else adopt a treatment of\\nmodality de re that is not parallel to the KP treatment. He\\nchooses the latter alternative. Although Socrates is in only the\\nactual world, Lewis holds, he has ‘counterparts’ in some\\nother worlds, objects that play the role in those worlds that he plays\\nin this world. If all Socrates’ counterparts are human, then we\\nmay say that he is essentially human. If one of Hubert\\nHumphrey’s counterparts won (the counterpart of) the 1968\\npresidential election, it is correct to say of Humphrey that he could\\nhave won that election.\\n\\nIn addition to the obvious stark ontological contrast between the two\\ntheories, they differ in two important ways in their implications for\\nthe philosophy of modality. First, if Lewis is right, then modal\\nconcepts can be defined in terms of paradigmatically non-modal\\nconcepts, since ‘world’ and all of Lewis’s other\\ntechnical terms can be defined using only ‘is spatiotemporally\\nrelated to’, ‘is a part of’ and the vocabulary of\\nset theory. For Kripke and Plantinga, however, modal concepts are\\nsui generis, indefinable or having only definitions that\\nappeal to other modal concepts. Secondly, Lewis’s theory implies\\na kind of anti-realism concerning modality de re. This is\\nbecause there is no one relation that is the counterpart\\nrelation—there are rather various ways or respects in which one\\ncould say that objects in two worlds “play the same role”\\nin their respective worlds. Socrates, therefore, may well have\\nnon-human counterparts under one counterpart relation and no non-human\\ncounterparts under another. And the choice of a counterpart relation\\nis a pragmatic or interest-relative choice. But on the KP theory, it\\nis an entirely objective question whether Socrates fails to be human\\nin some world in which he exists: the answer must be Yes or No and is\\nindependent of human choices and interests.\\n\\nWhatever one may think of these theories when one considers them in\\ntheir own right (as theories of modality, as theories with various\\nperhaps objectionable ontological commitments), one must concede that\\nthey are paradigmatically metaphysical theories. They bear witness to\\nthe resurgence of metaphysics in analytical philosophy in the last\\nthird of the twentieth century.\\n3.2 Space and Time\\n\\nLong before the theory of relativity represented space and time as\\naspects of or abstractions from a single entity, spacetime,\\nphilosophers saw space and time as intimately related. (A glance\\nthrough any dictionary of quotations suggests that the philosophical\\npairing of space and time reflects a natural, pre-philosophical\\ntendency: “Had we but world enough, and time …”;\\n“Dwellers all in time and space”.) Kant, for example,\\ntreated space and time in his Transcendental Aesthetic as\\nthings that should be explained by a single, unified theory. And his\\ntheory of space and time, revolutionary though it may have been in\\nother respects, was in this respect typical of philosophical accounts\\nof space and time. Whatever the source of the conviction that space\\nand time are two members of a “species” (and the only two\\nmembers of that species), they certainly raise similar philosophical\\nquestions. It can be asked whether space extends infinitely in every\\ndirection, and it can be asked whether time extends infinitely in\\neither of the two temporal “directions”. Just as one can\\nask whether, if space is finite, it has an “end” (whether\\nit is bounded or unbounded), one may ask of time whether, if it is\\nfinite, it had a beginning or will have an end or whether it might\\nhave neither, but rather be “circular” (be finite but\\nunbounded). As one can ask whether there could be two extended objects\\nthat were not spatially related to each other, one can ask whether\\nthere could be two events that were not temporally related to each\\nother. One can ask whether space is (a) a real thing—a\\nsubstance—a thing that exists independently of its inhabitants,\\nor (b) a mere system of relations among those inhabitants. One can ask\\nthe same question about time, and also about modality. (See Wallace\\n(2019) for an elucidation of temporal/ modal analogies.)\\n\\nBut there are also questions about time that have no spatial\\nanalogues—or at least no obvious and uncontroversial analogues.\\nThere are, for example, questions about the grounds of various\\nasymmetries between the past and the future—why is our knowledge\\nof the past better than our knowledge of the future?; why do we regard\\nan unpleasant event that is about to happen differently from the way\\nwe regard an unpleasant event that has recently happened?; why does\\ncausation seem to have a privileged temporal direction? There do not\\nseem to be objective asymmetries like this in space.\\n\\nThere is also the question of temporal passage—the question\\nwhether the apparent “movement” of time (or the apparent\\nmovement of ourselves and the objects of our experience through or in\\ntime) is a real feature of the world or some sort of illusion. In one\\nway of thinking about time, there is a privileged temporal direction\\nmarking the difference between the past, present, and future.\\nA-theorists hold that time is fundamentally structured in terms of a\\npast/present/future distinction. Times change from past to present to\\nfuture, giving rise to passage. (The name ‘A-theorist’\\ndescends from J.M.E. McTaggart’s (1908) name for the sequence\\npast/present/future which he called the ‘A-series’.)\\nWithin the A-theory, we might further ask whether the past and future\\nhave the “same sort of reality” as the present. Presentist\\nA-theorists, like Prior 1998, deny that the past or future have any\\nconcrete reality. Presentists typically think of the past and future\\nas, at best, akin to abstract possible worlds—they are the way\\nthe world was or will be, just as possible worlds are ways the actual\\nworld could be. Other A-theorists, like Sullivan (2012), hold that the\\npresent is metaphysically privileged but deny that there is any\\nontological difference between the past, present, and future. More\\ngenerally, A-theorists often incorporate strategies from modal\\nmetaphysics into their theories about the relation of the past and the\\nfuture to the present.\\n\\nAccording to B-theories of time, the only fundamental distinction we\\nshould draw is that some events and times are earlier or later\\nrelative to others. (These relations are called\\n‘B-relations’, a term also derived from McTaggart).\\nAccording to the B-theorists, there is no objective passage of time,\\nor at least not in the sense of time passing from future to present\\nand from present to past. B-theorists typically maintain that all past\\nand future times are real in the same sense in which the present time\\nis real—the present is in no sense metaphysically\\nprivileged.\\n\\nIt is also true, and less often remarked on, that space raises\\nphilosophical questions that have no temporal analogues—or at\\nleast no obvious and uncontroversial analogues. Why, for example, does\\nspace have three dimensions and not four or seven? On the face of it,\\ntime is essentially one-dimensional and space is not essentially\\nthree-dimensional. It also seems that the metaphysical problems about\\nspace that have no temporal analogues depend on the fact that space,\\nunlike time, has more than one dimension. For example, consider the\\nproblem of incongruent counterparts: those who think space is a mere\\nsystem of relations struggled to explain our intuition that we could\\ndistinguish a world containing only a left hand from a world\\ncontaining only a right hand. So it seems there is an intuitive\\norientation to objects in space itself. It is less clear whether the\\nproblems about time that have no spatial analogues are connected with\\nthe one-dimensionality of time.\\n\\nFinally, one can raise questions about whether space and time are real\\nat all—and, if they are real, to what extent (so to speak) they\\nare real. Might it be that space and time are not constituents of\\nreality as God perceives reality but nevertheless “well-founded\\nphenomena” (as Leibniz held)? Was Kant right when he denied\\nspatial and temporal features to “things as they are in\\nthemselves”?—and right to contend that space and time are\\n“forms of our intuition”? Or was McTaggart’s\\nposition the right one: that space and time are wholly unreal?\\n\\nIf these problems about space and time belong to metaphysics only in\\nthe post-Medieval sense, they are nevertheless closely related to\\nquestions about first causes and universals. First causes are\\ngenerally thought by those who believe in them to be eternal and\\nnon-local. God, for example—both the impersonal God of Aristotle\\nand the personal God of Medieval Christian, Jewish, and Muslim\\nphilosophy—is generally said to be eternal, and the personal God\\nis said to be omnipresent. To say that God is eternal is to say either\\nthat he is everlasting or that he is somehow outside time. And this\\nraises the metaphysical question of whether it is possible for there\\nto be a being—not a universal or an abstract object of some\\nother sort, but an active substance—that is everlasting or\\nnon-temporal. An omnipresent being is a being that does not occupy any\\nregion of space (not even the whole of it, as the luminiferous ether\\nof nineteenth-century physics would if it existed), and whose causal\\ninfluence is nevertheless equally present in every region of space\\n(unlike universals, to which the concept of causality does not apply).\\nThe doctrine of divine omnipresence raises the metaphysical question\\nwhether it is possible for there to be a being with this feature.\\nAnte res universals are said by some of their proponents\\n(precisely those who deny that universals are constituents of\\nparticulars) to have no relations to space and time but\\n“vicarious” ones: the ante res universal\\n“whiteness” may be said to be present where each white\\nparticular is, but only in a way analogous to the way in which the\\nnumber two is present where each pair of spatial things is. But it is\\ndoubtful whether this is a position that is possible for a\\nmetaphysician who says that a white thing is a bundle composed of\\nwhiteness and various other universals. Those who believe in the\\nexistence of in rebus universals are fond of saying, or have\\nbeen in recent years, that these universals (‘immanent\\nuniversals’ is a currently popular name for them) are\\n“multiply located”—“wholly present” at\\neach place at which the things that fall under them are present. And\\nby this they certainly do not mean that whiteness is present in many\\ndifferent regions of space only vicariously, only as a number might be\\nsaid to be present wherever there are things in that number, only in\\nvirtue of bearing the non-spatial relation “being had by”\\nto a multitude of particulars each of which is present in a single\\nregion of space. All theories of universals, therefore, raise\\nquestions about how things in various ontological categories are\\nrelated to space. And all these questions have temporal analogues.\\n3.3 Persistence and Constitution\\n\\nRelated to questions about the nature of space and time are questions\\nabout the nature of objects that take up space or persist through\\ntime, and these questions form yet another central theme in\\npost-medieval metaphysics. Are some or all objects composed of proper\\nparts? Must an object have proper parts in order to “fill\\nup” a region of space—or are there extended simples? Can\\nmore that one object be located in exactly the same region? Do objects\\npersist through change by having temporal parts?\\n\\nMuch work on persistence and constitution has focused on efforts to\\naddress a closely knit family of puzzles—the puzzles of\\ncoincidence. One such puzzle is the “problem of the statue and\\nthe lump”. Consider a gold statue. Many metaphysicians contend\\nthat there is at least one material object that is spatially\\nco-extensive with the statue, a lump of gold. This is easily shown,\\nthey say, by an appeal to Leibniz’s Law (the principle of the\\nnon-identity of discernibles). There is a statue here and there is a\\nlump of gold here, and—if the causal story of the statue’s\\ncoming to be is of the usual sort—the lump of gold existed\\nbefore the statue. And even if God has created the statue (and\\nperforce the lump) ex nihilo and will at some point\\nannihilate the statue (and thereby annihilate the lump), they further\\nargue, the statue and the lump, although they exist at exactly the\\nsame times, have different modal properties: the lump has the property\\n“can survive radical deformation” and the statue does not.\\nOr so these metaphysicians conclude. But it has seemed to other\\nmetaphysicians that this conclusion is absurd, for it is absurd to\\nsuppose (these others say) that there could be spatially coincident\\nphysical objects that share all their momentary non-modal properties.\\nHence, the problem: What, if anything, is the flaw in the argument for\\nthe non-identity of the statue and the lump?\\n\\nA second puzzle in this family is the “problem of Tib and\\nTibbles”. Tibbles is a cat. Call his tail “Tail”.\\nCall all of him but his tail “Tib”. Suppose Tail is cut\\noff—or, better, annihilated. Tibbles still exists, for a cat can\\nsurvive the loss of its tail. And it would seem that Tib will exist\\nafter the “loss” of Tail, because Tib lost no part. But\\nwhat will be the relation between Tib and Tibbles? Can it be identity?\\nNo, that is ruled out by the non-identity of discernibles, for Tibbles\\nwill have become smaller and Tib will remain the same size. But then,\\nonce again, we seem to have a case of spatially coincident material\\nobjects that share their momentary non-modal properties.\\n\\nBoth these constitution problems turn on questions about the\\nidentities of spatially coincident objects—and, indeed, of\\nobjects that share all their (proper) parts. (A third famous problem\\nof material constitution—the problem of the Ship of\\nTheseus—raises questions of a different sort.) Some\\nmetaphysicians contend that the relation between the lump and the\\nstatue, on the one hand, and the relation between Tib and Tibbles, on\\nthe other, cannot be fully understood in terms of the concepts of\\nparthood and (non-) identity, but require a further concept, a\\nnon-mereological concept, the concept of “constitution”:\\nthe pre-existent lump at a certain point in time comes to constitute\\nthe statue (or a certain quantity of gold or certain gold atoms that\\nfirst constituted only the lump come to constitute them both);\\npre-existent Tib at a certain point in time comes to constitute\\nTibbles (or certain cat-flesh or certain molecules …). (Baker\\n2000 is a defense of this thesis.) Others contend that all the\\nrelations between the objects that figure in both problems can be\\nfully analyzed in terms of parthood and identity. For a more thorough\\noverview of the solutions to these puzzles and different theories of\\nconstitution in play, see Rea (ed.) 1997 and Thomson 1998.\\n3.4 Causation, Freedom and Determinism\\n\\nQuestions about causation form yet a fourth important category of\\nissues in the “new” metaphysics. Of course, discussion of\\ncauses go back to Ancient Philosophy, featuring prominently in\\nAristotle’s Metaphysics and Physics. But\\nAristotle understood ‘cause’ in a much broader sense than\\nwe do today. In Aristotle’s sense, a ‘cause’ or\\n‘aiton’ is an explanatory condition of an\\nobject—an answer to a “why” question about the\\nobject. Aristotle classifies four such explanatory conditions—an\\nobject’s form, matter, efficient cause, and teleology. An\\nobject’s efficient cause is the cause which explains change or\\nmotion in an object. With the rise of modern physics in the\\nseventeenth century, interest in efficient causal relations became\\nacute, and it remains so today. And when contemporary philosophers\\ndiscuss problems of causation, they typically mean this sense.\\n\\nOne major issue in the metaphysics of causation concerns specifying\\nthe relata of causal relations. Consider a mundane claim: an iceberg\\ncaused the Titanic to sink. Does the causal relation hold\\nbetween two events: the event of the ship hitting the iceberg and the\\nevent of the ship sinking? Or does it hold between two sets of states\\nof affairs? Or does it hold between two substances, the iceberg and\\nthe ship? Must causal relations be triadic or otherwise poly-adic? For\\nexample, one might think that we are always required to qualify a\\ncausal claim: the iceberg, rather than the captain’s negligence,\\nwas causally responsible for the ship’s foundering. And can\\nabsences feature in causal relations? For example, does it make sense\\nto claim that a lack of lifeboats was the cause of a third-class\\npassenger’s death? Bernstein (2014) and Sartorio (2004) argue\\nthat absences can be causes. Beebee (2004) suggests that absences are\\ncausal explanations, but not causes.\\n\\nAnother question taken up by contemporary literature is whether\\ncausation comes in degrees. For example: if two people lift a heavy\\nplank and one person bears more of the weight, has one person\\ncontributed more than the other to the lifting of the plank? Bernstein\\n(2017) suggests that causation comes in degrees, but that most\\nmetaphysical theories of causation cannot account for this idea.\\nDemirtas (2022) and Kaiserman (2018) agree, while Sartorio (2020)\\nargues that the appearance that causation comes in degrees is\\nillusory, and can be explained away.\\n\\nWe might further ask whether causal relations are objective and\\nirreducible features of reality. Hume famously doubted this,\\ntheorizing that our observations of causation were nothing more than\\nobservations of constant conjunction. For example, perhaps we think\\nicebergs cause ships to sink only because we always observe\\nship-sinking events occurring after iceberg-hitting events and not\\nbecause there is a real causal relation that holds between icebergs\\nand foundering ships.\\n\\nContemporary metaphysicians have been attracted to other kinds of\\nreductive treatments of causation. Some—like Stalnaker and\\nLewis—have argued that causal relations should be understood in\\nterms of counterfactual dependencies (Stalnaker 1968 and Lewis 1973).\\nFor example, an iceberg’s striking the ship caused its sinking\\nat time t if and only if in the nearest possible worlds where\\nthe iceberg did not strike the ship at time t, the ship did\\nnot sink. Others have argued that causal relations should be\\nunderstood in terms of instantiations of laws of nature. (Davidson\\n(1967) and Armstrong (1997) each defend this view albeit in different\\nways.) All of these theories expand on an idea from Hume’s\\nTreatise in attempting to reduce causation to different or\\nmore fundamental categories. (For a more complete survey of recent\\ntheories of causation, see Paul and Hall 2013.)\\n\\nDebates about causation and laws of nature further give rise to a\\nrelated set of pressing philosophical questions—questions of\\nfreedom. In the seventeenth century, celestial mechanics gave\\nphilosophers a certain picture of a way the world might be: it might\\nbe a world whose future states were entirely determined by the past\\nand the laws of nature (of which Newton’s laws of motion and law\\nof universal gravitation served as paradigms). In the nineteenth\\ncentury the thesis that the world was indeed this way came to be\\ncalled ‘determinism’. The problem of free will can be\\nstated as a dilemma. If determinism is true, there is only one\\nphysically possible future. But then how can anyone ever have acted\\notherwise? For, as Carl Ginet has said (1990: 103), our freedom can\\nonly be the freedom to add to the actual past; and if determinism\\nholds, then there is only one way that the given—the\\nactual—past can be “added to”. But if determinism\\ndoes not hold, if there are alternative physically possible futures,\\nthen which one comes to pass must be a mere matter of chance. And if\\nit is a mere matter of chance whether I lie or tell the truth, how can\\nit be “up to me” whether I lie or tell the truth? Unless\\nthere is something wrong with one of these two arguments, the argument\\nfor the incompatibility of free will and determinism or the argument\\nfor the incompatibility of free will and the falsity of determinism,\\nfree will is impossible. The problem of free will may be identified\\nwith the problem of discovering whether free will is\\npossible—and, if free will is possible, the problem of giving an\\naccount of free will that displays an error in one of (or both) these\\narguments.\\n\\nVan Inwagen (1998) defends the position that, although the modern\\nproblem of free will has its origin in philosophical reflections on\\nthe consequences of supposing the physical universe to be governed by\\ndeterministic laws, the problem cannot be evaded by embracing a\\nmetaphysic (like dualism or idealism) that supposes that agents are\\nimmaterial or non-physical. This leads into our next and final sample\\nof topics from the “new” metaphysics.\\n3.5 The Mental and Physical\\n\\nIf it is natural both to pair and to oppose time and space, it is also\\nnatural to pair and to oppose the mental and the physical. The modern\\nidentity theory holds that all mental events or states are a special\\nsort of physical event or state. The theory is parsimonious (among its\\nother virtues) but we nevertheless exhibit a natural tendency to\\ndistinguish the mental and the physical. Perhaps the reason for this\\nis epistemological: whether our thoughts and sensations are physical\\nor not, the kind of awareness we have of them is of a radically\\ndifferent sort from the kind of awareness we have of the flight of a\\nbird or of a flowing stream, and it seems to be natural to infer that\\nthe objects of the one sort of awareness are radically different from\\nthe objects of the other. That the inference is logically invalid is\\n(as is so often the case) no barrier to its being made. Whatever the\\nreason may be, philosophers have generally (but not universally)\\nsupposed that the world of concrete particulars can be divided into\\ntwo very different realms, the mental and the material. (As the\\ntwentieth century passed and physical theory rendered\\n“matter” an increasingly problematical concept, it became\\nincreasingly common to say “the mental and the physical”.)\\nIf one takes this view of things, one faces philosophical problems\\nthat modern philosophy has assigned to metaphysics.\\n\\nProminent among these is the problem of accounting for mental\\ncausation. If thoughts and sensations belong to an immaterial or\\nnon-physical portion of reality—if, for example, they are\\nchanges in immaterial or non-physical substances—how can they\\nhave effects in the physical world? How, for example, can a decision\\nor act of will cause a movement of a human body? How, for that matter,\\ncan changes in the physical world have effects in the non-physical\\npart of reality? If one’s feeling pain is a non-physical event,\\nhow can a physical injury to one’s body cause one to feel pain?\\nBoth questions have troubled “two realm”\\nphilosophers—or ‘dualists’, to give them their more\\nusual name. But the former has troubled them more, since modern\\nphysics is founded on principles that assert the conservation of\\nvarious physical quantities. (See Bennett (2021) for discussion of the\\ncomparative explanatory demands of physicalism and dualism.) If a\\nnon-physical event causes a change in the physical\\nworld—dualists are repeatedly asked—does that not imply\\nthat physical quantities like energy or momentum fail to be conserved\\nin any physically closed causal system in which that change occurs?\\nAnd does that not imply that every voluntary movement of a human body\\ninvolves a violation of the laws of physics—that is to say, a\\nmiracle?\\n\\nA wide range of metaphysical theories have been generated by the\\nattempts of dualists to answer these questions. Some have been less\\nthan successful for reasons that are not of much intrinsic\\nphilosophical interest. C. D. Broad, for example, proposed (1925:\\n103–113) that the mind affects the body by momentarily changing\\nthe electrical resistance of certain synapses in the brain, (thus\\ndiverting various current pulses, which literally follow the path of\\nleast resistance into paths other than those they would have taken).\\nAnd this, he supposed, would not imply a violation of the principle of\\nthe conservation of energy. But it seems impossible to suppose that an\\nagent could change the electrical resistance of a physical system\\nwithout expending energy in the process, for to do this would\\nnecessitate changing the physical structure of the system, and that\\nimplies changing the positions of bits of matter on which forces are\\nacting (think of turning the knob on a rheostat or variable resistor:\\none must expend energy to do this). If this example has any\\nphilosophical interest it is this: it illustrates the fact that it is\\nimpossible to imagine a way for a non-physical thing to affect the\\nbehavior of a (classical) physical system without violating a\\nconservation principle.\\n\\nThe various dualistic theories of the mind treat the interaction\\nproblem in different ways. The theory called ‘dualistic\\ninteractionism’ does not, of itself, have anything to say about\\nthe problem—although its various proponents (Broad, for example)\\nhave proposed solutions to it. ‘Occasionalism’ simply\\nconcedes that the “local” counterfactual dependence of the\\nbehavior of a physical system on a non-physical event requires a\\nmiracle. The theory of pre-established harmony, which substitutes\\n“global” for local counterfactual dependence of voluntary\\nphysical movements on the mental states of agents, avoids problems\\nwith conservation principles—but secures this advantage at a\\ngreat price. (Like occasionalism, it presupposes theism, and, unlike\\noccasionalism, it entails either that free will does not exist or that\\nfree will is compatible with determinism.)\\n‘Epiphenomenalism’ simply denies that the mental can\\naffect the physical, and contents itself with an explanation of why\\nthe mental appears to affect the physical.\\n\\nIn addition to these dualistic theories, there are monistic theories,\\ntheories that dissolve the interaction problem by denying the\\nexistence of either the physical or the non-physical: idealism and\\nphysicalism. (Present-day philosophers for the most part prefer the\\nterm ‘physicalism’ to the older term\\n‘materialism’ for reasons noted above.) Most current work\\nin the philosophy of mind presupposes physicalism, and it is generally\\nagreed that a physicalistic theory that does not simply deny the\\nreality of the mental (that is not an “eliminativist”\\ntheory), raises metaphysical questions. Such a theory must, of course,\\nfind a place for the mental in a wholly physical world, and such a\\nplace exists only if mental events and states are certain special\\nphysical events and states. There are at least three important\\nmetaphysical questions raised by these theories. First, granted that\\nall particular mental events or states are identical with particular\\nphysical events or states, can it also be that some or all mental\\nuniversals (‘event-types’ and ‘state-types’\\nare the usual terms) are identical with physical universals? Secondly,\\ndoes physicalism imply that mental events and states cannot really be\\ncauses (does physicalism imply a kind of epiphenomenalism)? Thirdly,\\ncan a physical thing have non-physical properties—might it be\\nthat mental properties like “thinking of Vienna” or\\n“perceiving redly” are non-physical properties of physical\\norganisms? This last question, of course, raises a more basic\\nmetaphysical question, ‘What is a non-physical property?’\\nAnd all forms of the identity theory raise fundamental metaphysical\\nquestions, ontological questions, questions like, ‘What is an\\nevent?’ and ‘What is a state?’.\\n3.6 Social Metaphysics\\n\\nRecent years have seen an outpouring of interest in social\\nmetaphysics, which takes the nature of the social world as its\\nsubject of study. Many contemporary social metaphysicians investigate\\nthe ontological natures of socially constructed groups, entities, and\\ninstitutions. Key questions include: what, exactly, are corporations,\\nrestaurants, and sports teams? What is the nature of money? What are\\nthe natures of social categories, like woman, Black,\\nlesbian, and disabled? What is the relationship\\nbetween individuals and macro-level social objects? What does it mean\\nto say that something is “socially constructed,” and what\\nis the difference between the social and the natural in the first\\nplace?\\n\\nRitchie (2013, 2015, 2020a and 2020b) draws a distinction between\\n“Type 1” social groups like corporations and institutions,\\nwhich are organized and structured, and “Type 2” social\\ngroups, like Blacks and women, which are less structured social kinds.\\nEpstein (2019) argues against these sorts of course-grained\\nclassifications, preferring to classify them according to their\\ninter-level metaphysical relationships. Ruben (1985) denies that\\nsocial groups and other macro-level social entities can be reduced to\\nindividuals. Korman (2020) takes up the question of the nature of\\nestablishments like restaurants in further detail, suggesting that\\nthey are neither material objects nor constituted by the buildings\\nthat they occupy. Uzquiano (2004) questions the persistence conditions\\nof social groups like the Supreme Court, and ultimately argues that\\nthey are similar to the persistence conditions for artifacts. Drawing\\non this idea, Richardson (2022) holds that social groups are concrete\\nmaterial particulars, since two different social groups can have\\nexactly the same members. \\n\\nOther metaphysicians examine the ontological status of money, and\\nespecially the status of virtual currency like bitcoin. Passinsky\\n(2020) distinguishes between descriptive and normative approaches to\\nexploring the topic, and argues in favor of the latter. In contrast,\\nWarmke (2021) takes a descriptive approach, suggesting that bitcoin is\\na fictional substance in a collectively co-authored story.\\n\\nThere has also been a recent surge of interest in the metaphysics of\\nrace and gender. Haslanger (2000) famously holds that (roughly)\\nx is a woman if one is oppressed on the basis of her\\nwomanhood. Haslanger’s approach is ameliorative, taking into\\naccount what sorts of concepts of gender and race might be most useful\\nin theorizing. Friendly to this approach, Ásta (2018) proposes\\na conferralist account of social categories, according to which social\\ncategories are externally conferred on individuals in specific\\ncontexts. Others have taken on the topic of the natures of more\\nspecific sorts of social categories: Bernstein (2020) suggests that\\nintersectional social categories like Black woman are to be\\nviewed as explanatorily unified and prior to the individual\\nconstituents like Black and woman. Jorba and\\nRodó de Zárate (2019) propose a framework of properties\\nand emergent experience to account for intersectionality.\\n\\nDembroff (2016) takes up the puzzle of sexual orientation, arguing for\\n“Bidimensional Dispositionalism.” According to that view,\\na person’s sexual orientation is grounded in a person’s\\ndispositions to engage in sexual behaviors under the ordinary\\nconditions for these dispositions. A person’s dispositions\\ninclude sexes and genders of persons that one is disposed to sexually\\nengage with under those conditions. Andler (2021) draws a distinction\\nbetween sexual orientation and sexual identity, arguing that the\\nlatter is a more suitable and more explanatorily powerful category for\\ncapturing the relevant phenomenon.\\n\\nThere is even a burgeoning meta-metaphysics of the social world,\\nexamining whether the central questions of social metaphysics are\\nsubstantive. Barnes (2017) and Mikkola (2017) challenge Sider’s\\n(2012) conception of a substantive question in metaphysics, on the\\ngrounds that it does not accommodate substantive questions in the\\nmetaphysics of gender. Richardson (forthcoming) disagrees. And while\\nsocial metaphysics is often taken to contrast with so-called\\n“fundamental” metaphysics (as in McKitrick (2018)),\\nseveral philosophers have recently pointed out that elements of the\\nsocial world might be fundamental, including Mason and Ritchie (2020)\\nand Bernstein (2021). Social metaphysics can be viewed as a\\ncounterexample to the thesis that metaphysics is the study of\\nfundamental reality, as suggested in Bennett (2017). Passinsky (2021)\\nholds that Finean metaphysics is a good framework for feminist\\nmetaphysics. Others such as Hacking (1999) and Díaz-León\\n(2015) investigate what it is for something to be socially\\nconstructed. See also the Social Ontology entry by Epstein (2021) for\\na comprehensive overview of social ontology. \\n4. The Methodology of Metaphysics\\n\\nAs is obvious from the discussion in\\n Section 3,\\n the scope of metaphysics has expanded beyond the tidy boundaries\\nAristotle drew. So how should we answer our original question? Is\\ncontemporary metaphysics just a compendium of philosophical problems\\nthat cannot be assigned to epistemology or logic or ethics or\\naesthetics or to any of the parts of philosophy that have relatively\\nclear definitions? Or is there a common theme that unites work on\\nthese disparate problems and distinguishes contemporary metaphysics\\nfrom other areas of inquiry?\\n\\nThese issues concerning the nature of metaphysics are further\\nconnected with issues about the epistemic status of various\\nmetaphysical theories. Aristotle and most of the Medievals took it for\\ngranted that, at least in its most fundamental aspects, the ordinary\\nperson’s picture of the world is “correct as far as it\\ngoes”. But many post-Medieval metaphysicians have refused to\\ntake this for granted. Some of them, in fact, have been willing to\\ndefend the thesis that the world is very different from, perhaps\\nradically different from, the way people thought it was before they\\nbegan to reason philosophically. For example, in response to the\\npuzzles of coincidence considered in\\n Section 3.3,\\n some metaphysicians have maintained that there are no objects with\\nproper parts. This entails that composite objects—tables,\\nchairs, cats, and so on—do not exist, a somewhat startling view.\\nAnd as we saw in\\n Section 3.1,\\n other metaphysicians have been happy to postulate the reality of\\nconcrete merely possible worlds if this posit makes for a simpler and\\nmore explanatorily powerful theory of modality. Perhaps this\\ncontemporary openness to “revisionary” metaphysics is\\nsimply a recovery of or a reversion to a pre-Aristotelian conception\\nof a “permissible metaphysical conclusion”, a conception\\nthat is illustrated by Zeno’s arguments against the reality of\\nmotion and Plato’s Allegory of the Cave. But no matter how we\\nclassify it, the surprising nature of many contemporary metaphysical\\nclaims puts additional pressure on practioners to explain just what\\nthey are up to. They raise questions of the methodology of\\nmetaphysics.\\n\\nOne attractive strategy for answering these questions emphasizes the\\ncontinuity of metaphysics with science. On this conception,\\nmetaphysics is primarily or exclusively concerned with developing\\ngeneralizations from our best-confirmed scientific theories. For\\nexample, in the mid-twentieth century, Quine (1948) proposed that that\\nthe “old/intermediate” metaphysical debate over the status\\nof abstract objects should be settled in this way. He observed that if\\nour best scientific theories are recast in the “canonical\\nnotation of (first-order) quantification” (in sufficient depth\\nthat all the inferences that users of these theories will want to make\\nare valid in first-order logic), then many of these theories, if not\\nall of them, will have as a logical consequence the existential\\ngeneralization on a predicate F such that F is satisfied only\\nby abstract objects. It would seem, therefore, that our best\\nscientific theories “carry ontological commitment” to\\nobjects whose existence is denied by nominalism. (These objects may\\nnot be universals in the classical sense. They may, for example, be\\nsets.) Take for example the simple theory, ‘There are\\nhomogeneous objects, and the mass of a homogeneous object in grams is\\nthe product of its density in grams per cubic centimeter and its\\nvolume in cubic centimeters’. A typical recasting of this theory\\nin the canonical notation of quantification is:\\n\\n∃Hx & ∀x(Hx→Mx=Dx×Vx)\\n\\n\\n(‘Hx’: ‘x is homogeneous’;\\n‘Mx’: ‘the mass of x in grams’;\\n‘Dx’: ‘the density of x in grams per cubic\\ncentimeter’; ‘Vx’: ‘the volume of x in\\ncubic centimeters’.) A first-order logical consequence of this\\n“theory” is\\n\\n∃x∃y∃z(x=y×z)\\n\\n\\nThat is: there exists at least one thing that is a product (at least\\none thing that, for some x and some y is the product of x\\nand y). And a product must be a number, for the operation\\n“product of” applies only to numbers. Our little theory,\\nat least if it is recast in the way shown above, is therefore, in a\\nvery obvious sense, “committed” to the existence of\\nnumbers. It would seem, therefore, that a nominalist cannot\\nconsistently affirm that theory. (In this example, the role played by\\n‘the predicate F’ in the abstract statement of\\nQuine’s “observation” is played by the predicate\\n‘…=…×…’.)\\n\\nQuine’s work on nominalism inspired a much broader program for\\napproaching ontological questions. According to\\n“neo-Quineans”, questions about the existence of abstract\\nobjects, mental events, objects with proper parts, temporal parts, and\\neven other concrete possible worlds are united to the extent that they\\nare questions about the ontological machinery required to account for\\nthe truth of our best-confirmed theories. Still, many questions of the\\nnew and old metaphysics are not questions of ontology. For example,\\nmany participants in the debate over causation are not particularly\\nworried about whether causes and effects exist. Rather, they want to\\nknow “in virtue of what” something is a cause or effect.\\nFew involved in the debate over the mental and physical are interested\\nin the question whether there are mental properties (in some sense or\\nother). Rather, they are interested in whether mental properties are\\n“basic” or sui generis—or whether they are\\ngrounded, partially or fully, in physical properties.\\n\\nIs there a unified methodology for metaphysics more broadly\\nunderstood? Some think the task of the metaphysician is to identify\\nand argue for explanatory relations of various kinds. According to\\nFine (2001), metaphysicians are in the business of providing theories\\nof which facts or propositions ground other facts or propositions, and\\nwhich facts or propositions hold “in reality”. For\\nexample, a philosopher might hold that tables and other composite\\nobjects exist, but think that facts about tables are completely\\ngrounded in facts about the arrangements of point particles or facts\\nabout the state of a wave function. This metaphysician would hold that\\nthere are no facts about tables “in reality”; rather,\\nthere are facts about arrangements of particles. Schaffer 2010\\nproposes a similar view, but holds that metaphysical grounding\\nrelations hold not between facts but between entities. According to\\nSchaffer, the fundamental entity/entities should be understood as the\\nentity/entities that grounds/ground all others. On Schaffer’s\\nconception we can meaningfully ask whether a table is grounded in its\\nparts or vice versa. We can even theorize (as Schaffer does) that the\\nworld as a whole is the ultimate ground for everything.\\n\\nAnother noteworthy approach (Sider 2012) holds that the task of the\\nmetaphysician is to “explain the world” in terms of its\\nfundamental structure. For Sider, what unites (good) metaphysics as a\\ndiscipline is that its theories are all framed in terms that pick out\\nthe fundamental structure of the world. For example, according to\\nSider we may understand ‘causal nihilism’ as the view that\\ncausal relations do not feature in the fundamental structure of the\\nworld, and so the best language for describing the world will eschew\\ncausal predicates.\\n\\nIt should be emphasized that these ways of delimiting metaphysics do\\nnot presuppose that all of the topics we’ve considered as\\nexamples of metaphysics are substantive or important to the subject.\\nConsider the debate about modality. Quine (1953) and Sider (2012) both\\nargue from their respective theories about the nature of metaphysics\\nthat aspects of the debate over the correct metaphysical theory of\\nmodality are misguided. Others are skeptical of the debates about\\ncomposition or persistence through time. So theories about the nature\\nof metaphysics might give us new resources for criticizing particular\\nfirst-order debates that have historically been considered\\nmetaphysical, and it is common practice for metaphysicians to regard\\nsome debates as substantive while adopting a deflationist attitude\\nabout others.\\n5. Is Metaphysics Possible?\\n\\nIt may also be that there is no internal unity to metaphysics. More\\nstrongly, perhaps there is no such thing as metaphysics—or at\\nleast nothing that deserves to be called a science or a study or a\\ndiscipline. Perhaps, as some philosophers have proposed, no\\nmetaphysical statement or theory is either true or false. Or perhaps,\\nas others have proposed, metaphysical theories have truth-values, but\\nit is impossible to find out what they are. At least since the time of\\nHume, there have been philosophers who have proposed that metaphysics\\nis “impossible”—either because its questions are\\nmeaningless or because they are impossible to answer. The remainder of\\nthis entry will be a discussion of some recent arguments for the\\nimpossibility of metaphysics.\\n\\nLet us suppose that we are confident that we are able to identify\\nevery statement as either “a metaphysical statement” or\\n“not a metaphysical statement”. (We need not suppose that\\nthis ability is grounded in some non-trivial definition or account of\\nmetaphysics.) Let us call the thesis that all metaphysical statements\\nare meaningless “the strong form” of the thesis that\\nmetaphysics is impossible. (At one time, an enemy of metaphysics might\\nhave been content to say that all metaphysical statements were false.\\nBut this is obviously not a possible thesis if the denial of a\\nmetaphysical statement must itself be a metaphysical statement.) And\\nlet us call the following statement the “weak form” of the\\nthesis that metaphysics is impossible: metaphysical statements are\\nmeaningful, but human beings can never discover whether any\\nmetaphysical statement is true or false (or probable or improbable or\\nwarranted or unwarranted).\\n\\nLet us briefly examine an example of the strong form of the thesis\\nthat metaphysics is impossible. The logical positivists maintained\\nthat the meaning of a (non-analytic) statement consisted entirely in\\nthe predictions it made about possible experience. They maintained,\\nfurther, that metaphysical statements (which were obviously not put\\nforward as analytic truths) made no predictions about experience.\\nTherefore, they concluded, metaphysical statements are\\nmeaningless—or, better, the “statements” we classify\\nas metaphysical are not really statements at all: they are things that\\nlook like statements but aren’t, rather as mannequins are things\\nthat look like human beings but aren’t.\\n\\nBut (many philosophers asked) how does the logical positivist’s\\ncentral thesis\\n\\nThe meaning of a statement consists entirely in the predictions it\\nmakes about possible experience\\n\\n\\nfare by its own standards? Does this thesis make any predictions about\\npossible experiences? Could some observation show that it was true?\\nCould some experiment show that it was false? It would seem not. It\\nwould seem that everything in the world would look the same—like\\nthis—whether this thesis was true or false. (Will the positivist\\nreply that the offset sentence is analytic? This reply is problematic\\nin that it implies that the multitude of native speakers of English\\nwho reject the logical positivists’ account of meaning somehow\\ncannot see that that sentence is true in virtue of the meaning of the\\nword “meaning”—which is no technical term but a word\\nof ordinary English.) And, therefore, if the statement is true it is\\nmeaningless; or, what is the same thing, if it is meaningful, it is\\nfalse. Logical positivism would therefore seem to say of itself that\\nit is false or meaningless; it would be seem to be, to use a currently\\nfashionable phrase, “self-referentially incoherent”.\\n\\nCurrent advocates of ‘metaphysical anti-realism’ also\\nadvocate a strong form of the thesis that metaphysics is impossible.\\nInsofar as it is possible to find a coherent line of argument in the\\nwritings of any anti-realist, it is hard to see why they, like the\\nlogical positivists, are not open to a charge of self-referential\\nincoherency. Indeed, there is much to be said for the conclusion that\\nall forms of the strong thesis fall prey to self-referential\\nincoherency. Put very abstractly, the case against proponents of the\\nstrong thesis may be put like this. Dr. McZed, a “strong\\nanti-metaphysician”, contends that any piece of text that does\\nnot pass some test she specifies is meaningless (if she is typical of\\nstrong anti-metaphysicians, she will say that any text that fails the\\ntest represents an attempt to use language in a way in which language\\ncannot be used). And she contends further that any piece of text that\\ncan plausibly be identified as “metaphysical” must fail\\nthis test. But it invariably turns out that various sentences that are\\nessential components of McZed’s case against metaphysics\\nthemselves fail to pass her test. A test-case for this very schematic\\nand abstract refutation of all refutations of metaphysics is the very\\nsophisticated and subtle critique of metaphysics (it purports to apply\\nonly to the kind of metaphysics exemplified by the seventeenth-century\\nrationalists and current analytical metaphysics) presented in van\\nFraassen 2002. It is a defensible position that van Fraassen’s\\ncase against metaphysics depends essentially on certain theses that,\\nalthough they are not themselves metaphysical theses, are nevertheless\\nopen to many of the criticisms he brings against metaphysical\\ntheses.\\n\\nThe weak form of the thesis that metaphysics is impossible is this:\\nthere is something about the human mind (perhaps even the minds of all\\nrational agents or all finite rational agents) that unfits it for\\nreaching metaphysical conclusions in any reliable way. This idea is at\\nleast as old as Kant, but a version of it that is much more modest\\nthan Kant’s (and much easier to understand) has been carefully\\npresented in McGinn 1993. McGinn’s argument for the conclusion\\nthat the human mind is (as a matter of evolutionary contingency, and\\nnot simply because it is “a mind”) incapable of a\\nsatisfactory treatment of a large range of philosophical questions (a\\nrange that includes all metaphysical questions), however, depends on\\nspeculative factual theses about human cognitive capacities that are\\nin principle subject to empirical refutation and which are at present\\nwithout significant empirical support.
